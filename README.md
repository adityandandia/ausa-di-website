# ausa-di-website
AUSA-DI (AI for Universal Surgical Assistance – Diagnostics &amp; Intervention) is a healthcare + AI initiative dedicated to making diagnostics and surgical decision support accessible in rural, underserved regions and as an assistant to major healthcare companies as well as Hospitals. This website is the central hub of the project, showcasing our mission, progress, and research.

🌍 Purpose

Healthcare inequality remains a pressing global challenge. Advanced hospitals in cities even though they have AI tools, they still suffer from some amount of delay during the surgical process, while rural communities often lack reliable diagnostics or surgical guidance. AUSA-DI bridges this gap by developing AI-powered healthcare solutions and fostering international collaboration between researchers, professionals, and institutions.

🖥️ Website Features

Founders Section – Introduces the team, their roles, and backgrounds.

Progress Tracker – Displays milestones and project achievements.

Research Library – Curated papers categorized by areas such as cardiology, neurology, diabetes, and surgical AI.

Surgery Recommendation Module – Demonstrates ongoing work in AI-based surgical decision support.

Global Focus – Tailored for both rural India and international partners (e.g., Japan, corporates), ensuring cultural and professional inclusivity.

🎨 Design

Built with a dark blue gradient theme, the site conveys trust, innovation, and clarity. Its mobile-friendly design ensures accessibility for healthcare workers, researchers, and policymakers alike.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js (with future AI integrations)

Deployment: GitHub Pages / Vercel

🚀 Vision

AUSA-DI is more than a project—it’s a long-term mission. By combining AI innovation, medical research, and global collaboration, we aim to deliver tools that make diagnostics and surgical support more accurate, affordable, and accessible for everyone, regardless of geography.
